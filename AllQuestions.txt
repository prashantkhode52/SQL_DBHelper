C# .NET Questions

What is MVC Framework ?
M-Model has domain data ; 
V-View has responsible for rendering the contents ;
C- Controller has ability to interact user with view b
************
What is Razor View Engine ?
Razor View engine is a markup syntax which helps us to write HTML and server-side code in web pages using C# or VB.NET.
It is server-side markup language however it is not at all a programming language.

# It must be always enclosed in @{ ... }
# Semicolon “;” must be used to ending statements
# Files have .cshtml extension.
# Variables are declared with var keyword
# Inline expressions (variables and functions) start with @
# C# code is case sensitive

Routings In MVC
MVC Works on Routing Engine .
User sends the request to routing engine.
if request is available on route table. then it goes to controller and renders the view.
If not available then it return 404 error
**************************
ActionResult(Reffered From https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/action-result-in-asp-net-mvc/)
1]Content Returning Results
ViewResult,PartialViewResult,PartialViewResult,EmptyResult,JsonResult,FileResult,JavascriptResult
2]Redirection Results
RedirectResult,RedirectToRoutResult
3]Status Results
HTTPStatusCode,HTTPUnauthorizedResult,HTTPNotFoundResult
----------------------------------------
Difference between RedirectResult and RedirectToRouteResult ?
In summary, RedirectResult is used for fixed URL redirections, while RedirectToRouteResult is used for redirection based on routing configurations, allowing for more flexibility in routing.

Filters in ASP.Net MVC
 $$ What are Action Filters in ASP.NET MVC?
If we need to apply some specific logic before or after action methods, we use action filters. We can apply these action filters to a controller or a specific controller action. Action filters are basically custom classes that provide a means for adding pre-action or post-action behavior to controller actions.
1]AuthorizationFilters - Authorize filter can be used to restrict access to a specific user or a role.
2]ActionFilters - Action Filters can be applied to either controller action or controller itself, with the help of action filter we can change the way, the action or controller gets executed.
Inbuilt Action filter are [OUTPUTECACHE] ,  [Authorize] , HandleError[View("Error.chtml")]
3]ResultFilters - Result Filters in ASP.NET mvc are specifically designed to work with the result of an action method.
                  Modifying or replacing the result before it gets executed.
4]ExceptionFilters
5]OutputCache filter can cache the output of a controller action for a specific duration.

In ASP.NET MVC, filters are used to perform logic before or after an action method is executed. There are several types of filters available, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a brief overview of each filter type along with a predefined filter example:

Authorization Filters:

These filters are used to authenticate and authorize requests before executing an action method.
Example: [Authorize] attribute restricts access to authenticated users.
Action Filters:

Action filters are executed before and after an action method is called.
Example: [HttpPost] attribute ensures that the action method can only be called via HTTP POST requests.
Result Filters:

Result filters are executed before and after the execution of action results.
Example: [OutputCache] attribute caches the output of an action method for a specified duration.
Exception Filters:

These filters handle exceptions that occur during the execution of an action method.
Example: [HandleError] attribute handles exceptions and displays custom error views.
Resource Filters:

Resource filters are executed at the beginning and end of each request.
Example: [ResponseCache] attribute caches the HTTP response for a specified duration.
Predefined filter example:

csharp
Copy code
[Authorize] // Authorization filter
[HttpPost] // Action filter
[OutputCache(Duration = 3600)] // Result filter
[HandleError] // Exception filter
[ResponseCache(Duration = 3600)] // Resource filter
public ActionResult Index()
{
    // Action method logic
}
These attributes can be applied to controller classes or individual action methods to implement various types of filtering behavior in ASP.NET MVC applications


********************************************
 What is the difference between ViewData, ViewBag and TempData?
All this present in ControllerBase Class.
Both ViewBag and ViewData are used to communicate between controller and corresponding view. But this communication is only for server call, it becomes null if redirect occurs. So, in short, it's a mechanism to maintain state between controller and corresponding view.
ViewBag  -only transfers data from controller to view, not visa-versa. ViewBag values will be null if redirection occurs.
ViewBag.Name="Prashant";   // It dynamic object. 
ViewData -only transfers data from controller to view, not vice-versa. It is valid only during the current request.
ViewData["Name"]="Prashant";  // It is dictionary Object Which holds the key and value pairs .

TempData - is used to transfer (Vise Versa )data from view to controller, controller to view, or from one action method to another action method of the same or a different controller.
TempData - is also a dictionary object that stays for the time of an HTTP Request. So, Tempdata can be used to maintain data between redirects, i.e., from one controller to the other controller.
TempData["Name"]= "Prashant" ; // It is also Dictionary objects
When TempData is used ?
E.g When a user submits a form, the form data is typically sent to an action method for processing.

Q1. What are the differences between ViewData ViewBag TempData and session?
Both are almost similar and it helps us to transfer the data from controller to view whereas TempData also works during the current and subsequent requests (which means redirecting from one page to another)..
Q2. Which is better ViewBag or ViewData?
 ViewData is faster than ViewBag.
--------------------------------
different between @Model and @model ?
One is used to declare the strong type that the model is, and the other is used to access the model itself
-----------------------
Q. Difference between  @Html.LabelFor() And @Html.TextBoxFor() ?
-In summary, @Html.LabelFor() is used for generating labels, while @Html.TextBoxFor() is used for generating text input fields in ASP.NET MVC forms. They work together to create a well-structured and accessible form for capturing user input.
--------------------------------------------------
Key Differences Between IEnumerable and IQueryable in C# ?
Query Location: The main difference between them is where the query is executed. For IEnumerable, it’s in the client’s memory, whereas for IQueryable, it’s in the remote data source (e.g., a database).

Query Translation: IQueryable can translate the query into a different language (like SQL), which is impossible with IEnumerable.

Suitability: Use IEnumerable for LINQ to Objects and working with in-memory data. Use IQueryable when querying data from a database or other remote sources, as it allows for efficient querying and retrieval.
--------------------------
Anti-Forgery Token:
When Forms renders in the browser. The hiden token is created internally and after the submission of forms it checks the same token valid or not . So it Extra layer of security to reduce th cross browser Attacks (Cross-Site Request Forgery )

OOPS
The ref and out keywords in C# are both used for passing arguments to methods by reference, allowing the method to modify the original value of the argument.

What is ref and OUT Kewords in C# ? (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ref-and-out-keywords-in-c-sharp/)
ref - 
It is necessary the parameters should initialize before it pass to ref.
When ref keyword is used the data may pass in bi-directional.
--
OUT - It is not necessary to initialize parameters before it pass to out.
When out keyword is used the data only passed in unidirectional.

--------------
is it possible for abstract class to use interface ?
Yes, it is absolutely possible for an abstract class to implement an interface in C#. This allows the abstract class to define a contract specified by the interface and provide implementations for its members.

WEB API MVC
Explain the use of dependency injection in ASP.NET MVC.
-Dependency injection is a design pattern used in ASP.NET MVC to achieve loose coupling and better testability by injecting dependencies into a class rather than creating them within the class.
------------------------
HttpResponseMessage and its uses

HttpResponseMessage works with HTTP protocol to return the data with status/error. When we talk about response messages in Web API, we simply represent the receiving of some information from the method(s) that we created in Web API so that we can know what kind of response we will get, such as - success or failure. We can use HTTPResponseMessage to return the data as well as some user friendly messages.


#####################
LINQ (Linear Integrated Query)

First() - It returns the first element of a sequence otherwise gives the exception  if no element is found..
FirstOrDefault() - It returns the first element of a sequence, or a default value or null if no element is found.

Eg. var result = employeeList.FirstOrDefault || First (e => e.Department == "HR");

Difference btween DbContext And DbSet ?
DbContext is the primary class responsible for interacting with the database in Entity Framework.
DbSet is a property of the DbContext class representing a collection of entities of a specific type in the database.
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }
}
######################
SQL

deadlocks in sql 

A deadlock in SQL occurs when two or more transactions are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource. It can lead to a standstill in the database, and proper transaction management and isolation levels are crucial to avoid deadlocks.

Index in sql
Kind of structure which is used to retrive data fastly.

clustered index
stored data in physical order (ascending or descendin).
we can add index on single or composite key 

Non Clustered Index
is kind of structure which point b structure data.internally creates new data.It is like textbox index has page number from start to end for perticular chapter .
This index allows SQL Server to quickly locate and retrieve the relevant rows without scanning the entire table.
Eg. If User Need to Search City . It will point out the the cities from indexes tables and base on the key values , Quickly retrive cities from Main table.

In summary, a table with a primary key (which is a unique constraint) will have a clustered index by default, and you cannot add another clustered index to that table. Additional non-clustered indexes can be added as needed to support various query patterns.

********************
Fragmentation  - 
////Fragmentation is the kind of process which makes the empty spaces in the pages because of delete of process.
Fragmentation can refer to dividing the whole table data into smaller chunks
and storing them in different database or databases, or to the logical disorder and physical gaps of data pages in indexes. 
Fragmentation can impact the efficiency of backups, storage, I/O, memory, CPU, and query plans

Joins. (https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-practice-questions/)
Joins.
1]Inner Join
(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
2]Outer Join
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
3]Self Join
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
------------------------------------
The SQL UNION Operator

The UNiON Return only distinct values
The UNION ALL return all values (include duplicate also)
Eg.
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
------------------------------------
***The Group by function strucure** 
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);
-------------------------------------------
--CROSS APPLY AND OUTER APPLY
--In summary, OUTER APPLY includes all rows from the outer table (It acts like LEFT JOIN),
--while CROSS APPLY only includes matching rows (It acts like INNER JOIN).

--apply a function to each row of a table expression 
--and combine the results into a single result set.

 UA_NO  | UA_DEPTNO
  6     | 4,8,24,25,7,23,9,1,6,3,10,28,15,29,16,19,20,26,11,2,17,13,14,12,21,22,30,18,27,5

select *
from User_Acc CROSS  apply dbo.fn_split(( UA_DEPTNO ),',')  
WHERE UA_NO=1
-- IT Will devide the result into 30rows with as a Value column

Q. Best Practices For SQL Query Optimization  (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-practices-for-sql-query-optimizations/)
1. Use Where Clause instead of having
2. Avoid Queries inside a Loop
3. Use Select instead of Select *
4. Add Explain to the Beginning of Queries
5. Keep Wild cards at the End of Phrases
6. Use Exist() instead of Count()
