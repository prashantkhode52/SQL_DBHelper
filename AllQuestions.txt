Filters in ASP.Net MVC
 $$ What are Action Filters in ASP.NET MVC?
If we need to apply some specific logic before or after action methods, we use action filters. We can apply these action filters to a controller or a specific controller action. Action filters are basically custom classes that provide a means for adding pre-action or post-action behavior to controller actions.
1]AuthorizationFilters - Authorize filter can be used to restrict access to a specific user or a role.
2]ActionFilters - Action Filters can be applied to either controller action or controller itself, with the help of action filter we can change the way, the action or controller gets executed.
Inbuilt Action filter are [OUTPUTECACHE] ,  [Authorize] , HandleError[View("Error.chtml")]
3]ResultFilters - Result Filters in ASP.NET mvc are specifically designed to work with the result of an action method.
                  Modifying or replacing the result before it gets executed.
4]ExceptionFilters
5]OutputCache filter can cache the output of a controller action for a specific duration.

SQL

deadlocks in sql 

A deadlock in SQL occurs when two or more transactions are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource. It can lead to a standstill in the database, and proper transaction management and isolation levels are crucial to avoid deadlocks.

Index in sql
Kind of structure which is used to retrive data fastly.

clustered index
stored data in physical order (ascending or descendin).
we can add index on single or composite key 

Non Clustered Index
is kind of structure which point b structure data.internally creates new data.It is like textbox index has page number from start to end for perticular chapter .
This index allows SQL Server to quickly locate and retrieve the relevant rows without scanning the entire table.
Eg. If User Need to Search City . It will point out the the cities from indexes tables and base on the key values , Quickly retrive cities from Main table.

In summary, a table with a primary key (which is a unique constraint) will have a clustered index by default, and you cannot add another clustered index to that table. Additional non-clustered indexes can be added as needed to support various query patterns.

********************
Fragmentation  - 
////Fragmentation is the kind of process which makes the empty spaces in the pages because of delete of process.
Fragmentation can refer to dividing the whole table data into smaller chunks
and storing them in different database or databases, or to the logical disorder and physical gaps of data pages in indexes. 
Fragmentation can impact the efficiency of backups, storage, I/O, memory, CPU, and query plans
